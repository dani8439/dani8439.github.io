As a child I loved to learn. I wasn't one that had difficulty with settling down and getting to work, even if sometimes a topic would come along and leave me baffled. I remember sitting at the kitchen table with my mother, probably around 7 or 8 years old, and working out problem after problem using long division. It was the first time that I ever reached a wall in school and couldn't grasp a concept immediately. At the time it felt like it took an eternity to understand, when in reality it was probably only a week of trying. Every day after dinner, my mother and I would sit down together and she would try to help me understand how simple it was to divide over and over again, so long as one got the multiplication tables right. And then finally amidst doing perhaps the hundredth problem, everything just clicked. Suddenly everything made sense.

I haven’t been in school for a long time, and because of unforeseen circumstances that aren’t important, I haven’t been out in the workforce for the last 5 or 6 years. Going back to school is daunting at the best of times when you’re an adult, going back to school and learning a new language that I don’t really have any previous experience with is a harrowing prospect, but going back out into the “real world,” or at least taking the first tentative baby steps after spending years out of the workforce is downright terrifying. 

The most frequent question I ask myself while working through the labs and doing the readings, is am I retaining this? How on earth am I going to remember everything that I am learning through the program once I’m finished? I’m sorry to say that I don’t really have any shining solution to offer others doing the same, no panacea that will suddenly unlock the door to learning coding and make this a breeze when you’re doing it online, and what often feels like going it alone. The truth of the matter is, it sucks. The only thing that works is repetition, and time, and patience.  

The first leg of the course, I felt wobbly; like a newborn just learning how to take the first few steps but certainly not with the confidence that leads to graceful strides. There would be time to go back, and go over Ruby during the Procedural, and Object Oriented sections. There would be time to hammer in the concepts so that I didn’t feel like I was grasping at straws at times. 

Then I reached HTML & CSS, and I started to panic. It’s one thing to code along during the videos, to understand things as Jonathan somehow makes it all sound so very, very simple. But it never really feels that simple when he’s not there, and you’re trying to start from a blank slate and write a webpage as an exercise. Just a little side-project to show myself I know what I’m doing. But I don’t know what I’m doing; at least it doesn’t feel so most of the time. Most of the time, I feel like this:

At heart, I'm a nerd, so the first solution when stuck in a corner is to find books that explain things in a little more depth than the lessons are offering. [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1507565298&sr=8-1&keywords=html+and+css) is helping. It goes a little slower, and talks to the reader like they've no experience at all, so there aren't really moments of thinking what the hell is this? I don't remember reading about that! because he's tried to explain everything to you slowly, and carefully, like the not too bright toddler that you feel like when going about something new. 

[CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) is also a great, seemingly simple game that isn't really simple. It hammers in CSS selector's like nobody's business. Although, I've gotten to the end and have been told that I'm a rockstar, I don't believe it. 

There are lots of tools out there that can be used, it's just a matter of trial and error until you find something that you feel comfortable with. I've told myself I can't do everything, that even if I'm watching others seemingly leave me in the dust as they move through the course, I have no idea what their background is and whether or not they've done this before. That it might take me a little longer, that I might have to take a few days where it seems like I'm not coding, in order to read more about a topic that I'm having trouble understanding. 

Learning to code is hard, if it was easy then everyone would know how to do it. But at least I can tell myself I'm not like my father. Not when he asks me how on earth does he get to excel on a computer, and then looks at me cockeyed when I tell him it's in the applications folder. At least I know where that is.
