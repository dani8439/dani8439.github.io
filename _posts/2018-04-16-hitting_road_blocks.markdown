Time is not the enemy. I don’t know at what point I internalized the idea that faster is inevitably better. Because these last months, I’ve realized that it’s certainly not the case. Faster is not better, not when it makes you feel like you’re drowning just to keep your head above water. 

Some things have been happening in my life – some extraordinarily difficult things that we all deal with at some point – these last months, and it’s spilled over and made everything else difficult. It has been an emotional rollercoaster involving hospitals, and hospice care, and a very unexpected death that took my family by surprise, and one death that did not. For weeks there was the emotional up and down as this family member bottomed out, then recovered, then bottomed out again, then recovered, and then bottomed out… and then died… 

It’s been a gut punch, one that overshadows everything else in life. Grief comes pouring out in strange ways, and it can be a blackness that sucks everything up like a fog, making even thinking difficult. There’s an ache that comes, and there’s also an expectation that after a certain period of time, this feeling will pass. But rushing it is not healthy, nor is wallowing in it. Sometimes we just have to let things sit for a while, and deal with them, before focusing upon other things.  

I know that everyone has their own difficulties, and we are all trying to balance our personal lives and issues with trying to learn this huge new thing. It’s not an excuse. Only, all of this was happening and through it I had somehow worked my way very, *very* slowly through the second section of the curriculum, got to the final projects, and realized that I just couldn’t. Not that I would not, but that I could not presently go on. There were too many things from earlier sections that I was/am still too uneasy and uncertain with, things that confuse me every time I encounter it, and I make mistakes on. All these things are concepts that we have to understand in order to be good coders, and if I wasn’t grasping even the simplest things, then it was really foolish to try and press forward.  

I had to take a step back. 

I thought maybe I should go through certain sections of the curriculum for the third, fourth, or fifth time, and see if I understood finally before moving on. Then I remembered the books and resources that my mentor Tracey had given me at the very start of this journey. For the last weeks, I’ve been reading The Well-Grounded Rubyist, and all I can say, is that it is really, really helping. 

I’m going very slowly, I have to. I have to give myself time to understand all these building blocks so that my foundations are strong. If I can’t understand scope, and self, and objects, how on earth am I going to be able to more? I’ve tried to make a curriculum of sorts out of it, spending time writing out the concepts after I’ve read them for the third or fourth time, creating blocks of code from the examples, then running them in the IDE, and playing around with them so that I can read and comprehend what’s going on. 

I don’t know why I had this expectation that learning to code would be somewhat fast, and I’d be done in 8-10 months. Maybe it’s from seeing some of my fellow students just plow through the curriculum and move at a break neck speed. But we forget. I forgot how long it took me to learn things in college, how one has to study for many years in order to do most things as a career. It’s not something that happens in six, or eight months. Heck, I can’t count how many times Avi has said in the lectures that it took him x amount of time to learn y, to illustrate just how hard this is. And he's a damn good coder, but he's been doing this for *years*, decades really. 

And you know what, at some point in the last few weeks, I actually realized that I was starting to understand things. That looking at big blocks of code didn’t look so much like a foreign language anymore, and I was starting to be able to decipher small pieces, and not only understand what was going on, but even go so far as to predict the output before it occurred. And it feels good. Great even to start to understand things. I know the only reason though why a lot of things seem to be coming easier to me while reading the book, is because they are things that have been covered on learn. I don’t think that if I hadn’t done lessons, I would be able to fit the pieces together in my mind so clearly. 

I’ve changed my approach. It might take me another year to complete the program (though I dearly hope it will not), but I’m learning to be patient with myself. My goal each day is to understand something that I didn’t understand the day before. Slowly but surely, those little pieces will become a foundation, a strong one, and I’ll be a better coder because of it. A happier one too.
