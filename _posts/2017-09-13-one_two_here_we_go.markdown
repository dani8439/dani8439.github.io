I am not an over sharer. Nor am I someone that rejoices in social media. In fact, the idea of publishing things across the internet for all and sundry to see, really, *really* unnerves me. 

I like to hide in the shadows. I'm alright with that, in fine, I think it's perfect to exist in that hazy specter of uncertainty, where no one really knows what's up. 

Once upon a time, I was an architect, or rather on my way to becoming one. An architect can design sweeping, soul-crushing beauty, and as long as they're working for someone else, no one is ever going to know that one small person's name. They are just one small cog in one vast working machine, happy to contribute and help piece together an object of beauty. Unfortunately amidst trying to fulfill my goal of becoming one, I realized that as much as I loved design, as much as I loved the feeling of satisfaction that could be found, it wasn't the right thing for me.

I also happened to think that I sucked at it, so there's that too. 

Some people take a straight path from point A to point B, and others stop and start, veering off into the land of uncertainty, and eventually find themselves at the end point without ever realizing how on earth they got there. I veered off a long time ago, but of late, there has been the hope of steering things back onto a somewhat navigable course. 

Coding is the next step. Not so far removed from architecture and design, but different enough, and certainly challenging enough. Enough of a puzzle that can give the same kind of satisfaction I've felt in the passed, when things end up working out. 

Here's to hoping it works out too.
