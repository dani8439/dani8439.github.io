I am not an over sharer. Nor am I someone that rejoices in social media. In fact, the idea of publishing things across the internet for all and sundry to see, really, *really* unnerves me. But it's part of the requirement of the course, and a lot of the time what seems so daunting and unnerving is really just something we haven't tried before. So why the heck not? 

My path to coding isn't precisely straight, but it's not wibbly-wobbly either, or at least I hope it's not. So I've got that going for me, which is nice.

When I was still a cute little munchkin, and before reaching the age of snot nosed teenager, I loved puzzles. And from the very early age of 4 or 5 onwards, I wanted to be an architect, because what did an architect do but build a puzzle on a much larger scale! 

And then you know, life happened -  one undergraduate degree, several internships, and the beginning of a master's degree later, I realized that the whole Architecture thing wasn't really working out. Although there was the satisfaction of working as part of a larger machine, and although I took a great deal of pleasure in the studio environment of never-ending learning that was present in both professional and academic settings, something didn't quite fit. 

I also happened to think that I sucked at it, so there's that too. 

Some people take a straight path from point A to point B, and others stop and start, veering off into the land of uncertainty, and eventually find themselves at some place without ever realizing how on earth they got there. I think I took a U-Turn some time back, and haven't precisely known how to get back onto the main track. Of late however, I've had hope of steering things back onto a somewhat more navigable course. 

Coding is that next step. Not so far removed from architecture and design, but different enough, and certainly challenging enough. Enough of a puzzle that can give the same kind of satisfaction I've felt in the past, when things end up working out. 

Here's to hoping it works out too.
